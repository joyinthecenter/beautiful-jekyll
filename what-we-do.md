# What we do
At Haymarket Studio, we are curious about people who use what we make, the challenges and peculiarities of meeting those needs, and your ideas. Great things start when smart people collaborate with the audience we build for. As a consultancy, we help clients navigate abmiguity, create structure, and move forward effectively. Experienced in modern methodologies, frameworks, and tools—we pick the best ones for your job. No prebaked slide decks and oversold strategies. Just good choices based on deep experience and outcomes. 

Haymarket Studio also provides [remote classes and workshops](https://haymarketstudio.co/Classes) to build your team's Research and Design capabilities. 

Being small means flexibility to meet your situation. From one day workshops to long term engagements, We work with you in a way that meets your challenge. From an intial consultation, we can create a proposal that is nimble enough to adapt as we work together.
